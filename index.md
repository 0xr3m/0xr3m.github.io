Kanro operates as a scientific finance and direct donation initiative, swiftly channeling resources into high-potential pandemic solutions that are often missed by traditional institutional or commercial backers due to their early-stage nature or unconventional approaches, or lack of monetary rewards.

There's a primary focus on projects in low-income and lower-middle-income countries to tackle worldwide disparities by adopting a "ground-up" approach. However, we consider any project capable of delivering worldwide benefits, irrespective of its geographical location.

Based on our experience, projects that are fully open source or fall under the public domain have the highest likelihood of yielding significant gains, and so we only consider open source or IP-free projects.

We refrain from providing funds for indirect costs.
